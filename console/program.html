<p>  > Her name was Lain Iwakura. She was the first of only.</p><br>
<p>  > When was it? It's hard to say. 1998? 2001? 2015? It doesn't matter now. We're all stuck in the Present Day, the Present Time.</p>
<p>  > A girl came, seemingly from nowhere. We, as Knights found her. First on The Wired and again in the streets of Tokyo.</p>
<p>  > Lain was a quiet girl. Born to a cold mother and an absent father she was drawn to loneliness and later, insanity.</p>
<p>  > Lain's father turned out to be a very useful tool in maintaining her interest with NAVI's and The Wired.</p>
<p>  > She was told to write a diary. This diary became a log for her descent into madness and an insight into the pain humans can inflict upon each-other.</p>
<p>  > Alone with her thoughts Lain reached into The Wired to find answers and companionship.</p>
<p>  > What she found, well... She found us. First through Usagi and later visited by Eiri himself.</p>
<p>  > We enjoyed every moment our little Lain would give us. Voyuers and hackers flocked to watch footage and collect the entries.</p>
<p>  > Far from harmless, we played with the Devil. We sent her our collections of filth and depravity.</p>
<p>  > We slipped her deeper into the darkness. What suprised us was that she fought back.</p>
<p>  > Lain was quite the fast learner. Within weeks we taught her how to use The Wired, how to use our scripts and bots.</p>
<p>  > Some of us were getting excited. What a fun toy. Her potential was limitless.</p>
<p>  > You know dear reader, The Wired is so much more than a network. Our messiah; Eiri can modify and erase reality itself.</p>
<p>  > When he orchestrated important people into Lain's memories; Tomo, Misato and aliented Lain further we were in awe.</p>
<p>  > Anything he said would end up in the entries. The Knights worshipped his power.</p><br>

<p>  > Eiri's new program had run it's course,  she was completely out of control.</p>
<p>  > The software implanted false memories, paranoia, psychotic-tendency... Anything we desired.</p>
<p>  > Orchestrated events allowed these functions to breed in isolation. Separating her parents was <i>too easy.</i></p>
<p>  > By the time Lain started noticing the changes it was too late.</p>
<p>  > The real test of effect was a homicide, the murder of Usagi-san. There were many more. But Lain would never know.</p>
<p>  > We implanted a puppet. Lain thought of it as an avatar. A fantasy of hers. It was really just a tool to enforce our control.</p>
<p>  > Lain's curiosity made for a close call, she cracked Touko's server. Tachibana labs could have been implicated.</p>
<p>  > But The Knights are ever vigilant and we stopped her before she got too close. It was decided that she would need to be kept occupied.</p>
<p>  > So we started slowly deleting the memories of her father. She reacted in the most interesting way. She tried to recreate him.</p>
<p>  > At first her AI was just a simple chatbot. Later on it would speak and see. This "Progenitis" was very impressive.</p>
<p>  > Lain contacted a Knight chapter in MIT about it. We had to see how far she could take it, we gave her the Protocol 7 Accelerator.</p>
<p>  > Not only was she infected, but so was the Accelerator. Her creation would only evolve as we saw fit.</p>
<p>  > Though we had deleted Lain from the memories of her old acquaintances we tested her reaction with an unsolicited mail.</p>
<p>  > It seemed she no longer desired any human contact. We recognised this later as a sign of waning control.</p>
<p>  > Despite our programming she went to see Touko. We had prepared for the eventuality that she would download her data.</p>
<p>  > We needed to re-establish control and patch the vulnerability that allowed her to do this.</p>
<p>  > We sent more unsolicited mail, But she didn't respond to our puppet accounts of Usagi or Misato.</p>
<p>  > Fearing other rogue elements we dispatched of her mother. We then flooded the program with negative emotional data.</p>
<p>  > Lain, ever full of suprises created a copy of herself. Imbued with the Protocol 7 Accelerator it flooded the net.</p>
<p>  > We sent out deletion bots but couldn't be sure it was all deleted...</p>
<p>  > It came as a complete shock when she destroyed Progenitis and disappeared.</p>
<p>  > It was decided that we would merely monitor her. She became too dangerous for Eiri.</p>
<p>  > She started reacting to the programming again a year later. We had her delete her backup and enacted the final scenario.</p>
<p>  > We forced the puppet and overpowered her mind. We stole our perfect copy of Lain. Her Ego.</p>
<p>  > and then...<span id="lainicide" style="color:red;text-shadow:4px 4px #330000;"> We terminated her.</span></p><br>
